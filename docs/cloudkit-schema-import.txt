CloudKit Schema Configuration for References

Since the CloudKit Dashboard UI doesn't provide clear way to configure references,
here's what each reference field should point to:

## Game Record Type
- creator → User

## PlayerProfile Record Type  
- user → User

## PlayerAlias Record Type
- profile → PlayerProfile

## PlayerClaim Record Type
- game → Game
- claimantUser → User
- hostUser → User
- resolvedByUser → User

---

## How to configure in CloudKit Dashboard:

1. Click on the Record Type (e.g., "PlayerClaim")
2. Click on a reference field (e.g., "game")
3. Look for these configuration options:
   - "Reference Type" dropdown
   - "Action" settings
   - "Delete Action" (Cascade/None/Validate)
4. Set the appropriate target record type

If the UI still doesn't cooperate, the references will work anyway,
but queries that filter by reference type won't be as efficient.
The app code explicitly sets the reference types when creating records.
